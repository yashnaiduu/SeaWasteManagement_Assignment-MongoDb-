# Sea Waste Management and Plastic Recyclability System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system for managing sea waste and analyzing the recyclability of plastic waste collected from marine environments. The system includes features such as user authentication, real-time waste monitoring, waste collection management, plastic recyclability analysis, inventory management, notifications, reporting, search functionality, and a user-friendly interface.

## Features
1. **User Authentication and Authorization**
   - Secure user registration and login.
   - Role-based access control (e.g., admin, researcher, volunteer).

2. **Real-Time Waste Monitoring**
   - Utilize IoT sensors and drones to monitor waste levels in various marine locations.
   - Automated alerts for critical waste levels and illegal dumping.

3. **Waste Collection Management**
   - Schedule and manage waste collection operations using real-time data.
   - Optimize collection routes to minimize fuel consumption and operational costs.

4. **Plastic Recyclability Analysis**
   - Categorize collected plastic waste based on type and recyclability.
   - Provide detailed reports on recyclable materials and suggest recycling methods.

5. **Inventory Management**
   - Track the current inventory of collected waste.
   - Update inventory when new waste is added or removed.

6. **Notifications**
   - Send notifications to volunteers for scheduled waste collection operations.
   - Notify stakeholders about new reports and environmental events.

7. **Reporting**
   - Generate reports on waste collection, recyclability analysis, and environmental impact.
   - Visualize data with charts and graphs for better insights.

8. **Search Functionality**
   - Implement a powerful search engine to find information on waste collection and recycling quickly.
   - Provide advanced search options like keyword, location, and waste type.

9. **User Interface**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for both desktop and mobile users.
   - Provide different interfaces for admins, researchers, and volunteers.
